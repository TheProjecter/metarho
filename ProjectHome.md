# Overview #

MetaRho is a personal publishing platform with features focused on semantic web
technologies.  It is built on top of [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) using [Python](http://www.python.org/).

## Why Should You Use MetaRho? ##

You shouldn't, go use [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/).  No _really_, go use Wordpress.  It's a great blogging application that's easy to use, has a number of plug-in and easy to
theme.  MetaRho is **NOT** intended to be a wordpress knockoff though it will include a number of features to import and export Wordpress because everyone needs a way in and a way out.

Still here?

Alright then, it's possible you might find MetaRho useful if you really have a
desire to publish to the web and have it backed by strong structured data like
RDF, RDFa for better semantic web interaction and easy preservation or harvesting.  Have a desire to have content with stable and [sensible and stable URLs](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI).
